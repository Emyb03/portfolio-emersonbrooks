        <h1 class="about">ABOUT ME</h1>
        <h3 class="me">I am pursuing my Bachelors degree in Product Design with a minor in User Experience at the University of Minnesota. I have developed a wide range of skills that spans both technical and creative aspects of design. My passion for design come from my lifelong love for creativity. To me, design is not just about aesthetics; it’s about creating solutions that transform everyday tasks into a pleasurable experience. I’m dedicated to designing  products not only to serve their intended purpose but also enrich the lives who use them.
