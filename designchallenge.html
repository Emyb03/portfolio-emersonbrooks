            <p>My goal in this design challenge project is to reinvent the gardening bench in order to help gardeners who suffer from back issues.Â Working through the design process, I was able to conduct research to understand the particular needs of individuals with back issues while gardening. After examining the ergonomic limitations of current benches, I was able to come up with creative fixes, and create prototypes that put the comfort and welfare of users first. The ultimate goal was to design a gardening bench that makes gardening pain-free and encourages people who enjoy tending to their green spaces to feel happy and healthy.</p>
